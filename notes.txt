x86 has several
general purpose registers:
-%eax
-%ebx
-%ecx
-%edx

special-purpose registers:
-%edi
-%ebp
-%esp
-%eip

(edi can be used as general purpose)

movl $1, %eax

moves the number one into %eax

dollar sign indicates immediate mode addressing,
where a literal value is stored in the instruction 
and moved into a register

without the dollar sign we would be indicating
direct addressing, loading whatever number is at
address 1.

system calls are made by loading what call we want into
%eax, and setting up other needed registers, then calling
an interrupt with the 'magic' value 0x80

int 0x80
